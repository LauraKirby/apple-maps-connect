#An Apple Maps 'Thank You' Note  

In order to show the Apple technical manager that Iâ€™m passionate about becoming part of the Apple Maps team and building beautiful websites, I recreated Apple's, "Maps Connect" website with a thank you note. My intent was to demonstrate an understanding of content we discussed during the interview, while creating an unconventional way to thank the manager for her time.
